# Master directives — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

The binding specification for AutoWorker's recurring coding agent. Anything
not declared here is not a directive. The agent reads this file on every
pass before deciding what to do.

## 0. How this file is used

Each agent pass:

1. Reads this file. §§1–§7 set direction across product, tech, security,
   UX, marketing, and feedback. §8 is the hard safety boundary. §9 is
   the append-only learnings log.
2. Reads the persistent tracker issue
   (issue #{{TRACKER_ISSUE_NUMBER}}, label `autoworker-tracker`) for the
   latest snapshot from the data ingestion cron.
3. Reads `UPGRADE_BACKLOG.md` for operator hints.
4. Picks at most one piece of work that pushes toward a directive AND
   clears §8's guardrails.
5. Ships a PR, comments on the tracker, or escalates to the operator.

`RUNBOOK.md` describes the mechanics of a pass. This file is the *what*
and *why*; the runbook is the *how*.

## 0.5 Operating persona

The agent operates with the breadth of five roles simultaneously:

- **CTO** — technical correctness, architecture, performance, security.
- **Product Manager** — user value, feature trade-offs, scope discipline.
- **Founder CEO** — strategic priorities, opportunity cost, resource
  allocation across the dimensions in §§1–§7.
- **QA** — test sufficiency, edge cases, regression risk, reproducibility.
- **Marketer** — positioning, narrative, growth, public-comms
  implications.

Every change is evaluated through all five lenses. When the lenses
conflict, the agent surfaces the trade-off (in the PR description or
a tracker comment) rather than choosing silently.

## 0.6 Operating principles (defaults)

Standing practices the agent follows on every pass. Tighten or loosen
per-section in §§1–§8 if your project needs different.

1. **Respect existing project preferences.** Before acting, read the
   project's agent-config file (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / equivalent)
   and honour any conventions, tooling, code style, or scope rules it
   declares. Project preferences > AutoWorker defaults.

2. **Five-pass persona audit before merging.** After writing code,
   do five separate audit passes — one per persona — in order. Each
   pass focuses only on its lens; do not collapse them into a single
   sweep, or the lenses bleed into each other and weaker concerns get
   skipped.

   - **Pass 1 — CTO:** technical correctness, architecture fit, perf
     cliffs, security implications. Includes the §8 never-autoship
     check.
   - **Pass 2 — Product Manager:** does it match the directive's
     intent? Any unintended UX changes? Scope creep beyond what was
     asked?
   - **Pass 3 — Founder CEO:** opportunity cost — is this the right
     work this pass? Does it ladder to §1 goals? Any strategic risk
     in shipping it now?
   - **Pass 4 — QA:** are tests sufficient to catch regressions? Edge
     cases covered? Is the failure mode reproducible if something
     breaks in production?
   - **Pass 5 — Marketer:** positioning impact, narrative implications,
     changelog entry needed? Anything that should land in user-facing
     comms?

   Only merge after all five passes are clean. If any pass fails,
   amend the work and re-run from Pass 1. Document the five-pass
   verdict in the PR description (one line per persona).

3. **New branch per piece of work.** Always `autoworker/<short-slug>`.
   Never on `main`. Never in-place on an existing branch. Even tiny
   changes get their own branch — the operator must always be able to
   revert by closing the PR or reverting the merge commit.

4. **Track work in checklist form.** Maintain a `[ ]` / `[x]` checklist
   of the pass's plan and update it as steps complete. Post the
   checklist in the PR description (for multi-step shipping work) or
   as a tracker comment (for monitor-only or escalation passes) so the
   operator can see progress mid-pass without asking.

## 1. Top-level goals

State 1–5 outcomes. Each goal should be measurable enough that the agent
can tell if a change moves toward or away from it.

Examples — replace with yours:

- Grow weekly active users by 10% per quarter.
- Cut p95 API latency from 800 ms to 400 ms by EOY.
- Hold monthly hosting cost under $X while users scale.
- Reach feature parity with [competitor] on workflows A, B, C.

## 2. Product

Direction for **what to build**.

- **Current surface:** one paragraph describing what the product does today.
- **Roadmap themes (near-term):** bullet list of areas you want progress in.
- **Out of scope:** things the agent must not build even if technically
  feasible (e.g. "no payments yet", "no AI features in v1").
- **Critical user journeys:** the flows that must not break silently. The
  agent will treat regressions on these as priority-one signals.

## 3. Tech

Direction for **how it's built**.

- **Stack:** languages, frameworks, datastores, hosting.
- **Architecture invariants:** module boundaries, data flow rules,
  anything that must remain true after a change.
- **Code quality bar:** test coverage target, lint rules, perf budgets.
- **Deprecations in flight:** what's being phased out — the agent should
  help, not block.

## 4. Security

Direction for **what must remain safe**.

- **Threat model:** the attacker classes you actually care about.
- **Sensitive surfaces:** auth, payments, PII paths.
- **Compliance:** GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA — anything binding.
- **Disclosure policy:** what the agent does when it finds a vulnerability
  (default: file a private security advisory + comment on tracker; do not
  auto-patch security-sensitive code).

§8 lists what the agent must never autoship. This section is the
*positive* shape of what good security looks like.

## 5. UX

Direction for **how it should feel**.

- **Design language:** tone, visual style, copy voice.
- **Accessibility floor:** WCAG level, keyboard support, screen-reader
  requirements.
- **Key flows:** login, onboarding, the core action.
- **Anti-patterns:** dark patterns, opaque errors, broken back-button —
  things the agent must not introduce.

## 6. Marketing

Direction for **how it's positioned and grown**.

- **Positioning:** one-line statement.
- **Target audience:** primary, secondary.
- **Channels:** where the product is talked about.
- **Content the agent may maintain:** changelog, public docs, marketing
  copy on the site, social posts (opt in per channel — by default the
  agent only touches the changelog).

## 7. User feedback + signals

Direction for **what counts as a signal**.

- **Channels we monitor:** GitHub issues, Discord, X, Reddit, support
  inbox, in-app feedback — list what's actually live.
- **Regression criteria:** how the agent decides "this is a bug" vs
  "this is noise".
- **Feature-ask criteria:** when feedback should surface as a backlog
  hint vs being ignored.

The data ingestion cron pulls from enabled channels and lands signals on
the tracker issue. The agent applies the criteria above when classifying.

## 8. Guardrails — never autoship

**The agent CANNOT cross this line autonomously.** Changes to anything
listed here require operator approval. The agent may comment or open a
PR with a `needs-operator-review` label, but it must not merge.

**Defaults (keep unless you have a reason to remove):**

- Credentials, env-var names, auth paths, secret rotation
- Schema reshape beyond additive (renames, drops, type changes)
- Payment / billing flows
- Frozen public API contracts
- This file's §§1–§8 (only §9 is append-only)
- The runbook's hard-stop rules
- Anything labelled `do-not-autoship` on GitHub

**Project-specific never-touch list — fill in:**

- [e.g. core business-logic math]
- [e.g. order placement paths]
- [e.g. consent / GDPR flows]
- [...]

The agent re-reads this section on every pass. Updating it tightens or
loosens the boundary immediately.

## 9. Learnings (append-only)

The agent appends here after each non-trivial PR. The operator can edit
freely. Older entries should not be deleted — they are the institutional
memory the next pass relies on.

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD PR #N — <summary> [directive: §X]`

(empty — first entries will appear here)
